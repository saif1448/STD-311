Abstract class doesnt need to contain any abstract method. it is not mandatory

Abstract method does also demonstrate the property of inheritance.

For the case inheritance, a class cannot extend from multiple classes.

Allowed versions of inheritance are

1. Single
2. multi-level
3. We don't allow multiple inheritance because it can create ambiguity
4. Because of the diamond problem, we don't allow multiple inheritance
5. Hierarchial inheritance is allowed
6. Hybrid inheritance is not allowed


Interface
1. 100% abstract
2. There will be absolutely no concrete method in the interface
3. The property which is mentioned in the interface is by default final
4. Because of this the property mus be assigned a value
5. You dont have to use the abstract key word because by default everything is abstract here
6. When we want to use an interface, we have to use the implements keyword
7. You can force the use to override a method
8. We use interface to solve the multiple inheritance problem
